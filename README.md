# Nashdown-swift

### A work-in-progress implementation of a work in progress syntax ([Nashdown](https://github.com/alexford/nashdown)) for describing [Nashville Number System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_number_system) chord charts in a way that is both machine and human readable, implemented in Swift using [swift-parsing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing)

(There is also a nascent [Ruby implementation](https://github.com/alexford/nashdown-rb/) but development going forward will be in Swift)
